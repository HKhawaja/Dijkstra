# ShortestPaths - Dijsktra

An implementation of of Dijkstra's algorithm on a weighted, undirected graph, including an implementation of an adjacency list based weighted graph. The input graph will have a special property: it can be broken down into a 2-D grid of cells, where each cell has 4 special "corner" vertices shared with its neighbors, and all of the edges are between two vertices in the same cell or between a non-corner vertex in a cell and one of the corner vertices of the same cell.
